/**
 * An Flexiwan ACL Based Forwarding 'policy'.
 * This comprises the ACL index to match against and the forwarding
 * path to take if the match is successful.
 *
 * In comparison to original ABF plugin where the FWABF was forked of,
 * the FWABF policy uses flexiwan path labels and other criteria to choose link
 * for packet forwarding. The link can be either WAN interface if Direct Internet
 * Access (DIA) is wanted by user for this packet, of VXLAN/GRE tunnel.
 * To use flexiwan path labels user has to label Tunnel and WAN interfaces.
 * The links might be groupped, so user can prioritize groups of links to choose
 * link from.
 * FWABF policy consist of packet class against which packet should be matched,
 * and action to be performed on match. The packet class is implemented by ACL
 * rule and is referenced by ACL index. The action is specified in this module.
 *
 * ABF policies are then 'attached' to interfaces onto unicast-ip4/6 arcs.
 * When vlib buffer is received by FWABF vlib graph node, it is matched against
 * ACL database. If match was found, the packet will be routed by policy.
 * If no match was found, the buffer will be routed according original
 * ip4-lookup/ip6-lookup logic.
