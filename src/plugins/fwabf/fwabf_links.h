 * This file implements database of FWABF Links.
 * The FWABF Link object is abstraction of interface, either FlexiWAN tunnel

 * needed for the FlexiWAN multi-link policy feature, e.g. labels, DPO-s, etc.
 * Actually Link is a structure that extends the VPP software interface object.
 * It just keeps all FlexiWAN related logic separated of core VPP code.
 *
 * The main API function of this file is fwabf_links_get_dpo().
 * Once the FWABF Link database is filled with interfaces, labels, etc,
 * this API can be used to retrieve DPO object by FWABF label.
 * This DPO object then is used for forwarding packet to the labeled tunnel/WAN
 * interface.
